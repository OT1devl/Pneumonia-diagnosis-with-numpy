## üßë‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è **Introduction**
Pneumonia is an infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs. The goal of this project is to facilitate automated pneumonia diagnosis by analyzing X-ray images using **NumPy-based** data processing techniques. This is a **from-scratch** model implemented purely with NumPy, intended for **educational purposes** only, and **not** for real-world use.

This project is meant to demonstrate how machine learning can be implemented **without relying on external libraries**, showcasing fundamental concepts using only NumPy. It is **not designed for contributions or extensions**.

---

## ‚ö° **Features**
- **Image Processing:** Uses NumPy for handling and analyzing X-ray images.  
- **Custom Models:** Implements machine learning models without relying on high-level frameworks.  
- **Performance Evaluation:** Includes metrics to assess model accuracy and efficiency.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Prerequisites**
Before running the project, ensure you have the following Python packages installed:

- `NumPy`  
- `Matplotlib`  
- `cv2` (OpenCV)

---

## üì• **Installation**

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/OT1devl/Pneumonia-diagnosis-with-numpy.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Pneumonia-diagnosis-with-numpy
   ```

3. (Optional) Create a virtual environment to isolate dependencies:

   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

4. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

1. Ensure that X-ray images are located in the appropriate directory within the `datasets` folder.  

2. Run the training notebook to train the model:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook train.ipynb
   ```

3. Once trained, you can test the model's performance using the test notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook test.ipynb
   ```
